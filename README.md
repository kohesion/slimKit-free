slimKit-free version 0.1
============

The free version - Contains only minified / gzipped code

slimKit is a collection of UI widgets / helper functions I wrote and have been using professionally for years (some since 2001) for clients.

My approach to coding is minimalistic. These widgets are not Swiss Army knives, each widget does just one thing with a small number of configuration options that work well.

I am in the process of adapting them for public consumption.

The minified version without comments is available free. The un-minified source will be available for a nominal fee. Setup / support / customization is available.

slimKit is library agnostic and is written in plain javascript.

I only support the latest two major versions of each browser. Wider browser support is available as a customization service.
