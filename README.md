slimKit-free version 0.1
============

The free version - Contains only minified / gzipped code

slimKit is a collection of UI widgets / helper functions I wrote and have been using / maintaining professionally for years (some since 2001) for clients. I am in the process of adapting them for public consumption.

My approach to coding is minimalistic. These widgets are not Swiss Army knives, each widget does just one thing (well) with a small number of configuration options.

The minified version without comments is available free. The un-minified source will be available for a nominal fee. Setup / support / customization is available.

slimKit is library agnostic, written in plain vanilla javascript. No jquery required.

I only support the latest two major versions of each browser. Wider browser support is available as a customization service.

Why would you choose slimKit over bootstrap or jquery-ui? 
1) no commitment to an underlying framework / library<br>
2) this library is meticulously maintained by one person, the code is not going to get hacked up by 20 people.<br>
3) I don't do code / feature bloat, I believe in keeping it simple, complexity is for customization.<br>
4) If you need something more complicated or wider browser support, I offer customization service (hourly)<br>
5) I only support modern browsers by default resulting in simpler more elegant and efficient code<br>
6) I've been working with browser technology and/or javascript since 1996<br>
